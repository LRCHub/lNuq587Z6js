All this talking has turned
dangerous
Oh you speak so many languages
You could be spilling out your
heart
And I wouldn't understand at all
You know you got me thinking I
should be swallowing my pride
But is it pride or the choking
that comes before the fall
You say I got you worried,
'cause I drink too many beers
And each bottle's adding up to
the sum of all your fears
So I take the two drink maximum
With minimum regret on the rocks
Cuz I know that I don't have
nothing, yeah
And I don't need nothing, yeah
Cuz it don't mean nothing, yeah
If I don't have you
Last night, tonight, three
nights, four
How many more nights will I
spend on the couch or the floor
I never got an indication that
there might be something wrong
So I'd invite the invitation to
make out and move on
So come on I say, "I'm number
one can't you see"
You say "You don't look that way
to me, at your very best you're
number three"
And hell, I'd take four or five,
if that would guarantee your
company
Lying next to me
Cuz I don't have nothing, yeah
And I don't need nothing, yeah
Cuz it don't mean nothing, yeah
If I don't have you
Would it help to say I'm sorry
Would you believe me if I try
If I looked you in the face
Would you look me in the eye
If I kept all of my promises
Would you keep me up at night
