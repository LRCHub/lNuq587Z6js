You keep me up at night
Keep me up at night
It's like I'm hypnotized
Keep me up at night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All up in my system turn it up and let it blow
Once you're in my rhythm then you cannot let me go
She said, "Ooh, you freaky"
Got me thinking things like whoa
Thinking things like whoa, oh
You always had that look in your eyes
Like there was something you're tryna hide
But never did I think it could go this far
But here we are
Yeah, I lied, I lied, I lied
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You keep me up at night
Keep me up at night
It's like I'm hypnotized
Keep me up at night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You read my mind like it's jokes
Coming through the stereo
I know you want it head to toe
Take you for a miracle, a miracle
You always had that look in your eyes
Like there was something you're tryna hide
But never did I think it could go this far
But here we are
Yeah I lied, I lied, I lied
You keep me up at night
Keep me up at night
It's like I'm hypnotized
Keep me up at night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
