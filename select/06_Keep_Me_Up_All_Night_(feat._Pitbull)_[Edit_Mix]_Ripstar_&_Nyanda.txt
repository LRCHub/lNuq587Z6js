The boy say me love
He ain't going nowhere
Always thinking on me
From his mind I don't stray
I'm not a Heartbreaker
But love is a game
If you play with a fire
You get lost in my flame

Oh
Keep you up at night
Oh... Oh...

I'll be the thunder
I'll be the wonther
Keep you up at night
I'll be that feeling pulling you under
Keeps you at night
You won't be sleeping
But I'll have you dreaming
I'll be the girl that you fiend
Come fuck with me
I'll keep you up at night

I'll be the thunder
I'll be the wonther
I'll Keep you up at night
I'll be the thunder
I'll be the wonther
I'll keep you up at night

Don't be afraid baby
Come lemme give you a little lighting
Give you a little thunder
I swear I'm not lazy
I'll be putting them moves on a like firecracker

I'll be the thunder
I'll be the wonther
I'll Keep you up at night
I'll be that feeling pulling you under
Keeps you at night
You won't be sleeping
But I'll have you dreaming
I'll be the girl that you fiend
Come fuck with me

It's almost like the prettier they are
The more they break your heart
Stop
Let me start
Pretty eyes
Pretty lips
Pretty hair
Pretty hips
Pretty ass

It's almost like the prettier they are
The more they break your heart
Stop
Let me start
Oh man
That's a pretty
Pretty bitch

I'll be the thunder
I'll be the wonther
I'll Keep you up at night
I'll be that feeling pulling you under
Keeps you at night
You won't be sleeping
But I'll have you dreaming
I'll be the girl that you fiend
Come fuck with me

Oh
Keep you up at night
Oh. Oh.

You won't be sleeping
But I'll have you dreaming
I'll be the girl that you fiend
Come fuck with me
I'll keep you up at night
